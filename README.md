There are many kinds of communication networks nowadays, especially opportunistic social network.
In this network, human movement is used to move data to the entire network.
In this literature there is a nature of altruism (cooperative) on devices used by humans which is an important factor that can determine the performance of a protocol in the network.
However, in reality every device used by humans has limitations on storage media, power, and time of its use.
The cooperative nature eventually will be disadvantage to ourselves, because it will load our device.
Therefore, in this study we pin the value of selfishness on the device to reduce the load existing on the device.
In this paper, we study the effects of different distribution of altruism values and selfishness on delivery probability, latency, overhead ratio, buffer occupancy and total relay message performance in opportunistic social networks.
We evaluate the performance system of the SimBet routing protocol with the application of selfishness nodes using four types of human movements. 
In this study, we find that the selfishness value distributed evenly has an effect on reducing the load on the device, though not too significant to be compared with the value of selfishness which is only distributed to the popular nodes on the network.
